> **IMPORTANT**<br>
> If your want to use this yourself, **just fork it**. It's > 150 lines of TypeScript class methods. Shouldn't be too difficult. In other words, this repo is:
> * Not maintained
> * Not production ready
> * Not tested in any way, read the error messages if it breaks
> * Not configurable, and contains a lot of hardcoded values

## usage
Just read the docs from `index.ts`
